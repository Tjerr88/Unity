UNITY TRAINING SYSTEM
Built to endure. Ready for anything.

Official README — Professional Edition (Quickstart + Deep Dive)

QUICKSTART GUIDE

(Start Here — Everything you need to begin Unity today)

Unity is a simple, sustainable, full-body training system you can follow for years.
Every session follows the same structure:

1. Warm-Up (5–7 minutes)

Optional, but recommended.

2. Opener (1 lift)

Turkish Get Up (TGU) — controlled, technical, and low-rep.

3. Main Circuit (8 movement patterns, 3–5 rounds)

You perform one exercise per pattern, in random order, with controlled reps.

Patterns include:
Push, Pull, Squat, Lunge, Hinge, Rotation, Anti-Rotation, Loaded Carry.

4. Carry Finisher (30–120 seconds)

A single loaded carry or crawl for time.

Whole session: 30–40 minutes.

How often do I train?

5 days per week (designed for Mon–Fri, but flexible).

How long is a Unity block?

4 weeks →
20 sessions →
Then repeat with a new block.

Unity auto-generates a new block every time you press New Block.

Equipment needed

One kettlebell (your “Goldilocks bell”)

Optional: one heavier and one lighter bell for variations

Optional: TRX or space for bodyweight movements

Optional: running shoes for Zone 2

How hard should Unity feel?

Never maximal.
Unity is designed to be:

smooth

repeatable

sustainable

submaximal

low-stress

injury-resistant

If you finish a session feeling destroyed, you went too hard.

What if I miss a day?

Just train the next session.
Unity is not date-based. You always follow the next session.

What kettlebell weight should I use?

Your “Goldilocks bell” = the weight that feels:

not too light

not too heavy

allows crisp technique

feels like sustainable strength

Most people stick with the same bell for months, not weeks.

Should I add cardio?

Yes — if you feel recovered.

Unity includes an optional Zone 2 protocol (MAF method) for light, sustainable cardio.

Use it only on days when your recovery feels 80%+.

What about Strength Focus?

Optional feature that lets you emphasize one lift pattern per block.

If you don’t understand it yet, leave it off.
Unity works perfectly without it.

That’s all you need to start.

The rest of this document explains everything in depth.

DEEP DIVE — HOW UNITY WORKS
---------------------------------------------
1. Philosophy of Unity

Unity is built on one core idea:

Train in a way you can repeat for years.

Not 12-week transformations.
Not extreme peaking.
Not overreaching.
Not burnout cycles.

Unity is:

submaximal

technical

repeatable

movement-based

joint-friendly

energy-efficient

time-efficient

Unity keeps you strong, athletic, mobile, conditioned, and durable — without sacrificing recovery.

This is why Unity can be followed for 5, 10, even 20 years.

2. Session Structure (The Unity Formula)

Each session has three parts:

A. Warm-Up (optional, 5–7 minutes)

A simple, OS-inspired sequence:

Head nods (up/down & side)

Cross crawls

Rocking variations

Segmental rolls

2 minutes crawling

This prepares the nervous system without fatigue.

B. Opener — Turkish Get Up

Always the same:
1–2 reps per side, per round, for several rounds.

Why TGU?

full-body tension

shoulder stability

hip mobility

core integration

slow, technical strength

It’s the “primer” of the session.

C. Main Circuit — All 8 Movement Patterns

You perform 1 exercise per pattern:

Push

Pull

Squat

Lunge

Hinge

Rotation

Anti-Rotation

Loaded Carry (separate finisher)

Each session uses:

3–5 rounds

Random exercise selection

Controlled rep caps

Submaximal intensity

Every session looks different — but the structure stays identical.

D. Carry Finisher (time-based)

30–120 seconds of one loaded carry or crawl.
This builds:

grip strength

trunk stability

conditioning

resilience

gait patterning

Unity alternates between main carries (e.g., suitcase) and accessories (rack carry, bottom-up, bear crawl).

3. Block Structure (4 Weeks)

Unity uses a 4-week cycle, inspired by classic strength periodization:

Week 1 — Deload (15%)

Week 2 — Maintenance (22%)

Week 3 — Development (28%)

Week 4 — Stress (35%)

The percentages represent your block volume distribution.

Total block volume can be:

180

240

300 (default)

400

500 reps per pattern per block

More volume = more work = more conditioning + hypertrophy
Less volume = easier recovery, easier long-term adherence

4. Rep Caps & Rounds

Unity uses “caps” to keep sessions safe and sustainable.

Example (300-volume block):

3 rounds

cap = 5 reps per exercise per round

This prevents:

junk volume

technique breakdown

random overtraining

ego lifting

Reps stay crisp.
Session quality stays high.

5. Movement Patterns Explained

Unity trains the full human movement spectrum:

Push

pressing strength (floor press, military press, push press)

Pull

rowing, pulling, hinging with the upper back

Squat

bilateral and unilateral squat variations

Lunge

hip stability and strength through asymmetrical stance

Hinge

deadlifts, swings, explosive hip patterns

Rotation

TGU, windmills — controlled rotational strength

Anti-Rotation

snatch, one-arm swings, renegade rows — resisting rotation

Loaded Carry

suitcase, rack walk, bottom-up walk, bear crawl

This balanced approach makes Unity complete.

6. Strength Focus Overlay (Optional)

This optional feature emphasizes one grind pattern per block.

Unity redistributes that pattern’s volume into:

Light (L)

Medium (M)

Heavy (H)

Super Heavy (SH) (advanced mode only)

This creates gentle strength waves without burnout.

If you don’t understand it yet, skip it.
Unity works perfectly without Strength Focus.

7. Recovery & Readiness

Unity is built around sustainable recovery.

You should feel:

good

fresh

mobile

not wrecked

If you’re under-recovered:

drop weight

slow down

reduce reps

or skip Zone 2

Unity is a long game.

8. Zone 2 (Optional)

Unity includes a simple aerobic protocol:

Readiness Gate

Ask:

Slept well?

Low soreness?

Good energy?

Calm breathing?

3–4 yes → Zone 2 allowed
0–2 yes → Rest/walk only

MAF formula

180 – age
Zone 2 target = MAF – 10 → MAF

Example: age 35
145 – 10 → 145 = 135–145 bpm

Train 30–40 min at:

nose breathing pace

easy, conversational effort

no exhaustion

9. How to Progress in Unity

Unity has no forced progression.
Instead:

stay consistent

increase bell weight only when technique is perfect

never rush

every 8–12 weeks, evaluate your Goldilocks bell

stay submaximal

remain patient

your strength will grow naturally

Unity progression = slow, steady, permanent.

10. Frequently Asked Questions
