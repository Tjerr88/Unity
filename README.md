# UNITY TRAINING SYSTEM

**Built to endure. Ready for anything.**\
**Official README --- Unity 2025 Edition**

## Quickstart Guide

Unity is a sustainable, full-body training system built for long-term
progress with minimal equipment.\
You train five days per week using a 4-week block structure with
automatic wave loading.

Each session follows the same structure:

1.  Warm-Up (optional, 5--7 minutes)\
2.  Opener --- Turkish Get-Up (bias-adjusted)\
3.  Main Circuit --- 8 movement patterns\
4.  Carry Finisher

## Warm-Up (Optional)

A short preparation sequence inspired by Original Strength:

-   Head nods\
-   Cross crawls\
-   Rocking (multiple variations)\
-   Segmental rolls\
-   Easy crawling (2 minutes)

## Opener --- Turkish Get-Up

Unity automatically adjusts the opener using weekly bias:

-   Light bias: 2+2 Turkish Get-Ups per round\
-   Medium bias: 1+1 Turkish Get-Ups per round\
-   Heavy bias: Get-Up Sit-Up (1--3+3 per side depending on block
    volume)

Rounds are based on block size (usually 3).

## Main Circuit --- 8 Patterns

Each session includes one exercise per pattern:

-   Push\
-   Pull\
-   Squat\
-   Lunge\
-   Hinge\
-   Rotation (accessories only, TGU is always the opener)\
-   Anti-Rotation\
-   Loaded Carry (finisher)

Characteristics of the circuit:

-   Randomized exercise order\
-   Rep caps and rounds adjusted to block volume\
-   Light/medium/heavy bias per pattern\
-   Accessory rotation for balanced distribution\
-   Optional barbell replacements on heavy-bias days\
-   All rep counts automatically generated

## Carry Finisher

Unity uses carry units that translate into time (minimum 30 seconds).

-   Main carry day: Suitcase Carry\
-   Accessory days: Front Rack Carry, Overhead Carry, Bottom-Up Carry,
    Bear Crawl

Carry variations are automatically balanced across the block.

# Block Structure

Unity uses built-in wave loading across four weeks:

  Week   Focus         Percentage of Block Volume
  ------ ------------- ----------------------------
  1      Deload        15%
  2      Maintenance   22%
  3      Development   28%
  4      Stress        35%

# Volume Options

Unity supports five block sizes:

-   180 reps (shortest, easiest sessions)\
-   240 reps (moderate)\
-   300 reps (standard Unity dose)\
-   400 reps (optional high volume)\
-   500 reps (optional very high volume)

### Rounds and Rep Caps per Volume

  Volume   Rounds   Rep Cap per Round
  -------- -------- -------------------
  180      3        3
  240      3        4
  300      3        5
  400      4        5
  500      5        5

Light bias sets the cap to 10.\
Heavy bias increases the cap depending on block size.

# The Unity Progression Model

Unity is built around two progression paths that work together.

## 1. Volume Progression (per kettlebell)

With the same bell, run:

**180 → 240 → 300**

This builds technique, consistency, durability, and conditioning.

## 2. Weight Progression

When a 300-volume block feels:

-   technically clean\
-   non-grindy\
-   recoverable\
-   repeatable

move to a heavier kettlebell and repeat:

**180 → 240 → 300**

This creates sustainable, wave-like progress for years.

# About 400 and 500 Volume Blocks

These higher-volume blocks are optional.\
They exist primarily for lifters who only own **one kettlebell** and
want to maximize training effect before purchasing a heavier bell.

Use 400/500 when:

-   You only have one kettlebell\
-   You want more conditioning or hypertrophy\
-   You enjoy longer sessions\
-   Your recovery is excellent

Avoid 400/500 when:

-   You have access to multiple bells\
-   You prefer shorter sessions\
-   Life is stressful\
-   Recovery fluctuates

Most important:

**You never have to use 400 or 500. Unity never forces progression.\
You decide if you want to use them.**

The core progression remains:

**180 → 240 → 300 → heavier bell → repeat**

# Strength Focus (Optional)

Strength Focus adds a ProgramStrong-style intensity wave to a single
grind pattern:

-   Push\
-   Pull\
-   Squat\
-   Hinge

Unity assigns Light, Medium, Heavy (and in advanced mode: Super Heavy)
sessions across each week.

Strength Focus is optional and not required for progress.

# Optional Zone 2

Unity includes a dedicated Zone 2 page with:

-   A readiness gate (4 questions)\
-   The MAF formula (180 − age)\
-   Heart rate targets (MAF −10 to MAF)\
-   Guidelines for sustainable sessions (30--40 minutes, nose breathing)

Unity also suggests an Optional Run inside training sessions when total
reps fall below a block-specific threshold.

# Custom Exercise Matrix

Unity allows you to fully customize your training:

-   Change any main exercise\
-   Change accessories\
-   Mark exercises as ballistic (double rep conversion)\
-   Mark exercises as unilateral (left/right)\
-   Add barbell replacements for heavy-bias days\
-   Reset the entire matrix to defaults

All block generation adapts to your custom matrix.

# Skill Tests (Every \~8 Weeks)

Unity includes an integrated Skill Test page with auto-saving.

### Heavy-bell technique tests

-   One-arm Swing (10/10)\
-   Double Clean (5)\
-   Press (5/5)\
-   Double Front Squat (5)\
-   Snatch (5/5)\
-   Get-Up (1/1)

### Light-bell conditioning test

-   Snatch Test: 100 reps under 5 minutes\
    (Built-in timer with automatic result logging)

Unity tracks:

-   Last test\
-   Notes\
-   Reps\
-   Time\
-   Bell weight\
-   Whether it's time to retest (every 2 blocks)

# Equipment Recommendations

Start with:

-   One kettlebell (your "Goldilocks bell")

Optional additions:

-   Light bias bell (−4 kg)\
-   Heavy bias bell (+4 kg)\
-   Barbell for heavy-bias replacements\
-   Additional bells as you progress

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need more than one kettlebell?**\
No. Unity works perfectly with a single bell.

**Will I build muscle with Unity?**\
Yes. Sustainable hypertrophy comes from volume waves and submaximal
grinds.

**What happens if I miss sessions?**\
You simply continue with the next session.

**Do I need 400/500 blocks?**\
No. They are optional and not required for progress.

**Do I need Strength Focus?**\
No. It is completely optional.

**Is Unity sustainable long-term?**\
Yes. That is the core purpose of the system.

# Final Notes

Unity is designed to make you:

-   stronger\
-   leaner\
-   more durable\
-   better conditioned\
-   more athletic\
-   more resilient

without burnout or extremes.

Show up.\
Train submaximal.\
Follow the block.\
Let time do the work.

**That is Unity.**
