## QUICKSTART GUIDE  
*(Start here — everything you need to begin Unity today)*

Unity is a simple, sustainable, full-body training system you can follow for years.  
Every session follows the same structure:

### 1. Warm-Up (5–7 minutes)  
Optional, but recommended.

### 2. Opener (1 lift)  
**Turkish Get Up (TGU)** — controlled, technical, and low-rep.

### 3. Main Circuit (8 movement patterns, 3–5 rounds)  

You perform **one exercise per pattern** in random order, with controlled reps:

- Push  
- Pull  
- Squat  
- Lunge  
- Hinge  
- Rotation  
- Anti-Rotation  
- Loaded Carry  

### 4. Carry Finisher (30–120 seconds)  
A single loaded carry or crawl for time.

**Total session time:** about 30–40 minutes.

---

### How often do I train?

- Unity is designed for **5 days per week** (for example: Monday–Friday).
- You can shift days if needed, as long as you keep 5 sessions per week.

---

### How long is a Unity block?

- **4 weeks**  
- **20 sessions**  
- After finishing a block, you generate a **new block** in the app.

---

### Equipment needed

- One kettlebell (your “Goldilocks bell”)  
- Optional: one lighter and one heavier kettlebell  
- Optional: space for bodyweight and crawl work  
- Optional: running shoes for Zone 2

---

### How hard should Unity feel?

Unity should **never feel maximal**.

- You should finish sessions **tired but not destroyed**.  
- Technique should stay crisp.  
- You should be able to train again the next day.

If you feel wrecked after every session, you are doing too much.

---

### What if I miss a day?

- Nothing breaks. Just do **the next session**.  
- Unity is **session-based**, not tied to specific calendar dates.

---

### What kettlebell weight should I use?

Your **Goldilocks bell** is the kettlebell that:

- is not too light  
- is not too heavy  
- allows clean, repeatable technique  
- feels like you can use it for months

Most people stay with the same bell for many weeks or even months before moving up.

---

### Should I add cardio?

Yes, but only when you feel recovered.

- Unity includes an optional **Zone 2 protocol** (MAF method).
- Use it on non-Unity days or as separate sessions when recovery feels good.

---

### What about Strength Focus?

- Strength Focus is an **optional overlay** that emphasizes one lift pattern per block.
- If you are unsure, leave it **off**.  
- Unity is fully effective without Strength Focus.

## DEEP DIVE — HOW UNITY WORKS

### 1. Philosophy of Unity

Unity is built on one core principle:

> Train in a way you can repeat for years.

Unity is:

- submaximal  
- technical  
- repeatable  
- movement-based  
- joint-friendly  
- time-efficient  

It is **not**:

- a 6- or 12-week extreme plan  
- an all-out transformation program  
- built around maximal lifts or constant pushing to failure  

Unity is designed so you can follow it for **5–10+ years** without burning out.

---

### 2. Session Structure

Each Unity session has three main parts (plus an optional warm-up):

1. Warm-Up (optional)  
2. Opener (Turkish Get Up)  
3. Main Circuit (8 patterns)  
4. Carry Finisher

#### A. Warm-Up (5–7 minutes, optional)

A simple OS-inspired sequence:

- Head nods (20 up/down, 20 side-to-side)  
- Cross crawls (20 total)  
- Rocking with toes up (10 reps)  
- Rocking with toes down (10 reps)  
- Rocking with one leg extended sideways (5 reps per side)  
- Segmental rolls (3 per arm, 3 per leg)  
- Crawling (2 minutes, easy pace)

This prepares your body and nervous system without fatigue.

#### B. Opener — Turkish Get Up

The opener is always the **Turkish Get Up**.

- Low reps per side  
- Several controlled rounds  
- Focus on technique, not speed

Benefits:

- full-body strength  
- shoulder stability  
- hip mobility  
- core integration  
- improved body awareness

#### C. Main Circuit — 8 Movement Patterns

Unity uses one exercise per movement pattern:

- **Push**  
- **Pull**  
- **Squat**  
- **Lunge**  
- **Hinge**  
- **Rotation**  
- **Anti-Rotation**  
- **Loaded Carry** (as finisher)

Each session:

- chooses exercises per pattern  
- uses **3–5 rounds**  
- applies **rep caps** to keep volume and intensity under control  
- keeps everything submaximal and sustainable

No two sessions are exactly the same, but the **structure stays identical**.

#### D. Carry Finisher (30–120 seconds)

At the end of the session, you perform one carry or crawl for time, such as:

- Suitcase carry  
- Front rack carry  
- Bottom-up carry  
- Bear crawl  

This develops:

- grip strength  
- trunk stability  
- conditioning  
- resilience  
- gait and loaded walking patterns

---

### 3. Block Structure (4 Weeks)

Unity uses a **4-week cycle**, with different weekly emphases:

- **Week 1 — Deload (~15% of block volume)**  
- **Week 2 — Maintenance (~22%)**  
- **Week 3 — Development (~28%)**  
- **Week 4 — Stress (~35%)**

You choose a **total block volume** per pattern, for example:

- 180 reps  
- 240 reps  
- 300 reps (default)  
- 400 reps  
- 500 reps  

Unity then distributes that volume over the 20 sessions using the week percentages above.

Higher volume → more total work, more conditioning, more hypertrophy.  
Lower volume → easier to recover from, ideal for busy or stressful periods.

---

### 4. Rep Caps and Rounds

To keep training safe and sustainable, Unity uses:

- a fixed **number of rounds** per session  
- a **rep cap per exercise per round**

Example (300-volume block):

- 3 rounds  
- cap of 5 reps per exercise per round  

This prevents:

- ego lifting  
- sloppy technique  
- overaccumulation of fatigue  
- hidden overtraining  

Reps should feel strong and crisp.

---

### 5. The 8 Movement Patterns

Unity covers the full human movement spectrum:

- **Push**  
  - Pressing variations (floor press, military press, push press)  
- **Pull**  
  - Rowing and pulling (rows, cleans, high pulls, pull-ups)  
- **Squat**  
  - Bilateral and unilateral squats (goblet, front squat, pistols, step-ups)  
- **Lunge**  
  - Lunge patterns (reverse lunge, Bulgarian split squat, tactical lunge)  
- **Hinge**  
  - Deadlifts, swings, snatches, other hip-dominant lifts  
- **Rotation**  
  - Turkish Get Up, windmills, rotational patterns  
- **Anti-Rotation**  
  - One-arm swings, snatch, renegade rows, movements that resist rotation  
- **Loaded Carry**  
  - Suitcase carry, rack carries, bottom-up carries, crawl variations  

This keeps Unity balanced and complete across strength, control, and conditioning.

---

### 6. Strength Focus Overlay (Optional)

The **Strength Focus overlay** is an optional feature that emphasizes **one grind pattern** (Push, Pull, Squat, or Hinge) per block.

What it does:

- Redistributes that pattern’s work into different “intensity zones”:  
  - Light (L)  
  - Medium (M)  
  - Heavy (H)  
  - Super Heavy (SH) — advanced only  
- Keeps total volume controlled  
- Adds gentle waves of intensity across the weeks

If you are a beginner or don’t fully understand it yet, you can leave Strength Focus **off**.  
Unity remains fully effective without it.

---

### 7. Recovery and Readiness

Unity is built around **sustainable recovery**.

You should generally feel:

- refreshed after sleep  
- not overly sore  
- able to train again the next day  
- mentally willing to train

If you feel drained or your performance drops:

- reduce reps  
- lower kettlebell weight  
- skip Zone 2 temporarily  
- keep showing up, but do “easy mode” sessions

Unity is a long-term system. Short-term fatigue spikes are not the goal.

---

### 8. Zone 2 (Optional Cardio)

Unity includes an optional Zone 2 (MAF-based) cardio guideline for non-strength sessions.

#### Readiness Check

Only add Zone 2 if most of these are true:

- You slept well  
- Muscle soreness is low  
- You feel energetic in the morning  
- Your breathing is calm at rest  

If you get **3–4 YES** → Zone 2 is allowed (30–40 minutes, easy pace).  
If **0–2 YES** → rest or easy walk only.

#### MAF Formula

- **MAF = 180 − age**  
- Zone 2 target heart rate = **MAF − 10 to MAF**

Example:

- Age = 35  
- MAF = 180 − 35 = 145  
- Zone 2 = 135–145 bpm

Guidelines:

- Nose breathing only  
- You should be able to talk in full sentences  
- 30–40 minutes per session  
- Finish feeling better, not worse

---

### 9. How to Progress in Unity

Progress in Unity comes from:

- consistent training  
- occasional kettlebell upgrades  
- optional Strength Focus usage  
- improved execution quality (better form, smoother sets)

There is **no forced progression** like “add weight every week” or “add reps every session”.

Instead:

- stay submaximal  
- move with control  
- increase bell size only when everything feels easy and technically excellent  
- reassess your base kettlebell every 8–12 weeks

Your strength, conditioning, and body composition will improve over time if you maintain consistency.
