UNITY TRAINING SYSTEM

Built to endure. Ready for anything.
Official README — Professional Edition (Quickstart + Deep Dive)

QUICKSTART GUIDE

(Start here — everything you need to begin Unity today)

Unity is a simple, sustainable, full-body training system you can follow for years.

Every session follows this structure:

1. Warm-Up (optional, 5–7 minutes)
2. Opener (1 lift)

The opener is always the Turkish Get Up, with automatic bias logic:

Light bias: 2+2 TGUs × rounds

Medium bias: 1+1 TGUs × rounds

Heavy bias: Get-Up Sit-Up (higher reps per side, block-volume dependent)

This is handled automatically by the app.

3. Main Circuit (8 patterns, 3–5 rounds)

Push

Pull

Squat

Lunge

Hinge

Rotation (accessory rotation only; TGU always stays opener)

Anti-Rotation

Loaded Carry (appears as finisher)

Exercises are:

chosen from your matrix

randomized per session

adjusted for heavy/light bias

automatically balanced over the block

capped by rounds & rep limits based on block size

4. Carry Finisher

Unity uses carry units → converted into seconds (min. 30s).

Main carry days (Suitcase) alternate with accessory carry days
(Rack / OH / BU / Crawl).

How often do I train?

5 days per week

You simply complete the next session — no calendar attachment.

How long is a Unity block?

20 sessions

4 weeks

After finishing: tap New Block to generate a new one.

Equipment needed

Unity works with any setup, from 1 kettlebell to a full collection:

One kettlebell (your “Goldilocks bell”)

Optional: Light bias bell (−4 kg)

Optional: Heavy bias bell (+4 kg)

Optional: Barbell (barbell-mode replaces heavy-bias main lifts)

Space for carries and crawling

Shoes for optional MAF running

How hard should Unity feel?

Unity should never feel like a maximal effort.

Smooth reps

No grinding

You feel like you could do more

You can train again tomorrow

If sessions feel too heavy, lighten the bell or reduce reps.

What if I miss a day?

No problem.

Unity is session-based, not date-based.
Just do the next session.

What kettlebell weight should I use?

Your Goldilocks bell is:

not too light

not too heavy

repeatable with perfect technique

something you can use for months

Unity handles:

Light bias (−4 kg)

Medium bias (base)

Heavy bias (+4 kg)

automatically.

Should I add cardio?

Unity includes two options:

Optional Run
Displayed when a session’s total reps fall below your block-specific cutoff
(e.g., <75 reps in 300-volume).
→ 20–30 min @ MAF

Zone 2 Tab
With readiness check, MAF calculation, and guidelines.

What about Strength Focus?

Optional.
Strength Focus intensifies one grind pattern per block:

Push

Pull

Squat

Hinge

Zones:

L (Light)

M (Medium)

H (Heavy)

SH (Super Heavy, advanced only)

If unsure → leave off.
Unity is fully effective without it.

DEEP DIVE — HOW UNITY WORKS
1. Philosophy

Unity is built on one idea:

Train in a way you can repeat for decades.

Unity is:

submaximal

movement-based

joint-friendly

consistent

simple to follow

sustainable for years

suited for 1 KB up to full home gyms

compatible with busy lives

Unity is not:

a transformation challenge

random HIIT

maximal lifting

burnout-based conditioning

2. Session Structure
A. Warm-Up (5–7 minutes, optional)

Inspired by Original Strength:

Head nods

Cross crawls

Rocking variations

Segmental rolls

Light crawling

B. Opener — Turkish Get Up

Unity applies bias logic:

Light bias → 2+2 TGUs

Medium bias → 1+1 TGUs

Heavy bias → Get-Up Sit-Up, reps depend on block volume
(180 = lower; 300+ = higher)

Rounds = based on block size (usually 3).

C. Main Circuit — 8 Patterns

Each pattern gets:

One main lift

Accessory lifts when leftover volume exists

Randomized order

Bias adjustments

Accessory rotation to ensure balanced use

Barbell replacements on heavy days (optional)

Rounds and rep caps depend on block volume:

Volume	Rounds	Cap/round
180	3	3
240	3	4
300	3	5
400	4	5
500	5	5

Heavy bias increases cap (based on volume).
Light bias sets cap = 10 for that main lift.
Accessory volume fills leftover and rotates automatically.

D. Carry Finisher

Pre-computed using “carry units” → seconds.
Minimum duration = 30 seconds.

Main day = Suitcase Carry

Accessory days = Rack / Overhead / Bottom-Up / Crawl (balanced over block)

3. Block Structure (4 Weeks)

Unity uses built-in weekly waves:

Week 1 — Deload (15%)

Week 2 — Maintenance (22%)

Week 3 — Development (28%)

Week 4 — Stress (35%)

Choose your block volume:

180

240

300 (default, “full Unity dose”)

400

500

Everything — TGUs, rep caps, accessory volume, carry duration, run suggestion — scales automatically.

4. Optimal Use: Volume → Weight → Volume

(Unity’s long-term progression model)

Unity is designed around two simple progressions working together:

1. Volume progression (per kettlebell weight)

With the same bell:

180 → 240 → 300

This sequence builds:

conditioning

strength

technique

joint durability

session consistency

2. Weight progression (after 300 feels clean)

When you finish 300 with:

smooth technique

no grinding

good recovery

mental freshness

→ Move to a heavier bell
and repeat:

180 → 240 → 300 (with the new bell)

This creates sustainable, multi-year “wave cycles”.

5. About 400 and 500 Volume Blocks

(Higher volume — optional, not required)

Unity includes 400 and 500 blocks for a very specific reason:

They exist mainly for people who only own one kettlebell
and want maximum training effect before buying a heavier bell.

These blocks increase:

total workload

conditioning

hypertrophy stimulus

time under tension

When to use 400/500?

You only have 1 kettlebell

You want to delay buying a heavier bell

You enjoy longer sessions

Recovery is excellent

When not to use 400/500?

You have multiple bells

Life is stressful

Recovery is inconsistent

You don’t enjoy long sessions

Most important:

You never have to move into 400 or 500.
Unity does not force progression.
You decide whether you want it.

The core progression is:

180 → 240 → 300 → heavier bell → repeat

400/500 are tools — not requirements.

6. Strength Focus Overlay (optional)

Strength Focus intensifies a single grind pattern (Push, Pull, Squat, Hinge).

The app:

restructures weekly volume

assigns L / M / H (or L / M / H / SH in advanced)

shows zone breakdown per round

integrates fully with Unity’s block logic

If unsure → leave off.

7. Recovery & Readiness

You should feel:

minimal soreness

good sleep

stable energy

crisp technique

readiness to train again

mental willingness to show up

If fatigue spikes:

use lighter bell

reduce reps

skip Zone 2

perform “easy mode”

keep showing up

Unity prioritizes sustainability.

8. Optional Zone 2

Unity includes:

Readiness Gate

4 yes/no questions determine whether Zone 2 is recommended.

MAF formula

180 − age
Zone 2 = MAF − 10 to MAF

Guidelines

nose breathing

conversational pace

30–40 minutes

finish feeling refreshed

Zone 2 is optional and recovery-dependent.

9. Custom Exercises

The Custom Exercises tab lets you:

Change any main lift

Change any accessory

Mark lifts as ballistic (x2 reps)

Mark lifts as unilateral (+/+)

Add barbell replacements for heavy bias

Reset to defaults anytime

Unity uses this matrix to build your blocks.

10. Skill Tests (every ~8 weeks)

Unity includes a full Skill Test page with auto-logging:

Heavy-bell technique tests:

One-arm Swing (10/10)

Double Clean (5)

Press (5/5)

Double Front Squat (5)

Snatch (5/5)

Get-Up (1/1)

Light-bell volume test:

Snatch Test (100 reps < 5:00)
With built-in timer & auto-save.

Unity shows:

your last test results

recommended retest interval

a dot indicator when 2 blocks have passed

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Is Unity long-term?
Yes — that is the entire point.

Q: Does Unity build muscle?
Yes. Long-term hypertrophy from submaximal volume waves + grinds + carries.

Q: What if I miss days?
Just continue. Never catch up.

Q: Can I use just one kettlebell?
Yes. Unity supports 1–6 bells effortlessly.

Q: Should I buy more bells?
Only when your 300-block with your current bell feels easy.

Q: Are 400/500 needed?
No. They are optional tools.
